  desc: Designed and implemented a fully functional Convolutional Neural Network library in CUDA, allowing the timely processing of particle physics experimental data. My implementation consistently outperforms the previous CPU version by a factor of 3, as its performance and memory footprint is comparable to those of Keras.
